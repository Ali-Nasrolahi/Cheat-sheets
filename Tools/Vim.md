## Transforming and Substituting

### Transform

  - gU[motion] uppercase
  - gu[motion] lowercase

### Find and Substitute

- #### f vs t ---> f char included , t not included

  - > i.e assume "Hi! oh" --> df! results in " oh", however dt! makes it "! oh"

- #### use ; and , (comma) for next and prev appearance found by **f**

- #### :%s/old/new/g --> :[range]s/{pattern}/{string}/[flags] [count]

  - > % --> range means whole file could be *3,9* or *.,$* (from here to last line)
  - > g --> all occurrence
